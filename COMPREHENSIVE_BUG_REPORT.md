## CRITICAL BUGS (Must Fix Immediately)

### Bug #1: Mixed SQL Placeholders in company_info.py UPDATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/company_info.py`  
**Lines:** 227-238  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

**Description:**  
The `update()` method uses mixed SQL placeholder styles - both `?` (SQLite style) and `%s` (PostgreSQL style) in the same query. This will cause a syntax error when executed against a PostgreSQL database.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    UPDATE company_info
    SET entity_name = ?, address = ?, cin_no = ?, fy_start_date = ?,
        fy_end_date = ?, currency = ?, units = ?, number_format = ?,
        negative_format = ?, default_font = ?, default_font_size = ?,
        show_zeros_as_blank = ?, decimal_places = ?, turnover = ?,
        rounding_level = %s, updated_at = %s
    WHERE company_id = %s
''', (entity_name, address, cin_no, fy_start_date, fy_end_date,
      currency, units, number_format, negative_format, default_font,
      default_font_size, show_zeros_as_blank, decimal_places, turnover,
      rounding_level, datetime.now(), company_id))
```

**Issue:**  
- First 14 placeholders use `?` (SQLite style)
- Last 3 placeholders use `%s` (PostgreSQL style)
- PostgreSQL will reject this mixed syntax

**Impact:**  
- Application crash when trying to update company information
- Cannot save company settings
- Data modification operations fail

**Fix Required:**  
Change all placeholders to `%s` for PostgreSQL compatibility.

### Bug #2: Mixed SQL Placeholders in ppe.py UPDATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/ppe.py`  
**Lines:** 202-215  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

**Description:**  
The `update()` method in PPE model uses mixed placeholder styles AND uses MySQL-specific `NOW()` function.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    UPDATE ppe_schedule SET
        asset_class = ?,
        opening_gross_block_cy = ?, additions_cy = ?, disposals_gross_cy = ?,
        closing_gross_block_cy = ?,
        opening_acc_depreciation_cy = ?, depreciation_for_year_cy = ?,
        acc_depr_on_disposals_cy = ?, closing_acc_depreciation_cy = ?,
        opening_gross_block_py = ?, additions_py = ?, disposals_gross_py = ?,
        closing_gross_block_py = ?,
        opening_acc_depreciation_py = ?, depreciation_for_year_py = ?,
        acc_depr_on_disposals_py = ?, closing_acc_depreciation_py = ?,
        depreciation_rate = ?, useful_life_years = ?,
        updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE ppe_id = %s
''', (...))
```

**Issues:**  
1. Mixed placeholders: 18 `?` placeholders and 1 `%s` placeholder
2. `NOW()` is MySQL syntax, not PostgreSQL (should use Python's `datetime.now()` or PostgreSQL's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`)

**Impact:**  
- Application crash when updating PPE entries
- Database syntax errors
- Cannot modify fixed asset records

**Fix Required:**  
1. Change all placeholders to `%s`
2. Replace `updated_at = NOW()` with `updated_at = %s` and pass `datetime.now()` in parameters

### Bug #3: Mixed SQL Placeholders in cwip.py UPDATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/cwip.py`  
**Lines:** 195-201  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

**Description:**  
The `update()` method uses mixed placeholder styles.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    UPDATE cwip_schedule
    SET project_name = ?,
        opening_balance_cy = ?, additions_cy = ?, capitalized_cy = ?, closing_balance_cy = ?,
        opening_balance_py = ?, additions_py = ?, capitalized_py = ?, closing_balance_py = ?,
        project_start_date = ?, expected_completion_date = ?
    WHERE cwip_id = %s
''', (...))
```

**Issue:**  
- 11 placeholders use `?` (SQLite style)
- Last placeholder uses `%s` (PostgreSQL style)

**Impact:**  
- Cannot update Capital Work in Progress records
- Application crash during CWIP data modification

**Fix Required:**  
Change all placeholders to `%s`.

---

### Bug #4: Mixed SQL Placeholders in investments.py UPDATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/investments.py`  
**Lines:** 232-240  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

**Description:**  
The `update()` method uses mixed placeholder styles AND uses MySQL-specific `NOW()` function.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    UPDATE investments
    SET investment_particulars = ?, classification = ?, investment_type = ?,
        is_quoted = ?, quantity_cy = ?, quantity_py = ?,
        cost_cy = ?, cost_py = ?, fair_value_cy = ?, fair_value_py = ?,
        carrying_amount_cy = ?, carrying_amount_py = ?,
        market_value_cy = ?, market_value_py = ?,
        updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE investment_id = %s
''', (...))
```

**Issues:**  
1. 14 placeholders use `?` (SQLite style), 1 uses `%s`
2. `NOW()` is MySQL syntax, not PostgreSQL

**Impact:**  
- Cannot update investment records
- Database syntax errors

**Fix Required:**  
1. Change all placeholders to `%s`
2. Replace `updated_at = NOW()` with `updated_at = %s` and pass `datetime.now()` in parameters

## HIGH PRIORITY BUGS

### Bug #5: Missing RETURNING Clause in company_info.py CREATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/company_info.py`  
**Lines:** 182-194  
**Severity:** HIGH  

**Description:**  
The `create()` method executes an INSERT statement but tries to fetch the inserted ID without a RETURNING clause for PostgreSQL.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    INSERT INTO company_info (
        user_id, entity_name, address, cin_no, fy_start_date, fy_end_date,
        currency, units, number_format, negative_format, default_font,
        default_font_size, show_zeros_as_blank, decimal_places, turnover, 
        rounding_level, created_at, updated_at
    ) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
''', (...))

company_id = cursor.fetchone()[0]  # This will fail - no RETURNING clause
```

**Issue:**  
- PostgreSQL INSERT without RETURNING clause doesn't return any rows
- `cursor.fetchone()` will fail with "no results to fetch" error

**Impact:**  
- Cannot create new company records
- Application crash when adding new companies

**Fix Required:**  
Add `RETURNING company_id` to the INSERT statement.

---

### Bug #6: Missing RETURNING Clause in ppe.py CREATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/ppe.py`  
**Lines:** 151-171  
**Severity:** HIGH  

**Description:**  
The `create()` method tries to fetch the inserted ID without RETURNING clause.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    INSERT INTO ppe_schedule (...)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, ...)
''', (...))

ppe_id = cursor.fetchone()[0]  # Will fail
```

**Impact:**  
- Cannot create new PPE (fixed asset) entries
- Function crashes with exception

**Fix Required:**  
Add `RETURNING ppe_id` to the INSERT statement.

---

### Bug #7: Missing RETURNING Clause in cwip.py CREATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/cwip.py`  
**Lines:** 154-168  
**Severity:** HIGH  

**Description:**  
The `create()` method tries to fetch the inserted ID without RETURNING clause.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    INSERT INTO cwip_schedule (...)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, ...)
''', (...))

cwip_id = cursor.fetchone()[0]  # Will fail
```

**Impact:**  
- Cannot create new CWIP project records
- Application crash when adding new projects

**Fix Required:**  
Add `RETURNING cwip_id` to the INSERT statement.

---

### Bug #8: Missing RETURNING Clause in investments.py CREATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/investments.py`  
**Lines:** 188-204  
**Severity:** HIGH  

**Description:**  
The `create()` method tries to fetch the inserted ID without RETURNING clause.

**Current Code:**
```python
cursor.execute('''
    INSERT INTO investments (...)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, ...)
''', (...))

investment_id = cursor.fetchone()[0]  # Will fail
```

**Impact:**  
- Cannot create new investment records
- Application crash when adding investments

**Fix Required:**  
Add `RETURNING investment_id` to the INSERT statement.

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS

### Bug #9: Improper Connection Cleanup in company_info.py CREATE Method
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/company_info.py`  
**Lines:** 165-201  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  

**Description:**  
The `create()` method doesn't use proper exception handling and may not release database connections on certain errors.

**Current Code:**
```python
conn = get_connection()
cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    # ... validations and insert ...
    company_id = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return company_id

except Exception as e:
    conn.close()
    raise e
```

**Issue:**  
- No `finally` block to ensure connection is always closed
- No rollback on error before closing connection
- If an error occurs between `get_connection()` and the `try` block, connection is leaked

**Impact:**  
- Connection pool exhaustion over time
- Database performance degradation
- Application becomes unresponsive after repeated errors

**Fix Required:**  
Use `try-except-finally` pattern with proper rollback and connection cleanup.

---

### Bug #10: Improper Connection Cleanup in Multiple Model Files
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/models/ppe.py`, `cwip.py`, `investments.py`  
**Lines:** Various in CREATE and UPDATE methods  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  

**Description:**  
Several model files have connection management issues similar to Bug #9. While some use `finally` blocks, consistency varies across the codebase.

**Impact:**  
- Connection leaks in error scenarios
- Resource exhaustion

**Fix Required:**  
Standardize connection management across all models with proper `try-except-finally` blocks.

---

## LOW PRIORITY / CODE QUALITY ISSUES

### Bug #11: No Database Schema Migration System
**File:** `FinancialAutomation/config/database.py`  
**Lines:** Throughout the file  
**Severity:** LOW  

**Description:**  
The `initialize_database()` function doesn't check if tables already exist before attempting to create them (though it uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), and there's no migration system for schema changes.

**Issue:**  
- While using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` prevents errors, it doesn't validate table structure
- If schema changes are made, existing tables won't be updated
- No version tracking for database schema

**Impact:**  
- Schema drift between environments
- Difficult to upgrade database structure
- Manual intervention required for schema updates

**Fix Required:**  
Implement a database migration system (e.g., Alembic for Python) to manage schema changes.
