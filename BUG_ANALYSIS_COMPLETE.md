## Production Readiness

### Current Status: üî¥ NOT READY

**Blockers:**
- All CRITICAL bugs must be fixed before deployment
- Bug #5 particularly severe - breaks essential business functionality

### After Fixing Critical Bugs: üü° CAUTION

**Remaining Issues:**
- HIGH priority bugs limit ability to create new records
- Should be fixed before production

### After Fixing Critical + High: üü¢ READY

**Remaining Items:**
- Medium/Low priority bugs are code quality issues
- Can be addressed post-deployment with monitoring

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

1. **Review the documentation:**
   - Start with BUGS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for overview
   - Read COMPREHENSIVE_BUG_REPORT.md for details
   
2. **Prioritize fixes:**
   - Critical bugs MUST be fixed before any deployment
   - Bug #5 is especially urgent (breaks mapping)
   
3. **Create tickets:**
   - Use the bug list to create development tasks
   - Assign based on priority
   
4. **Fix and test:**
   - Fix critical bugs first
   - Add unit tests for database operations
   - Verify with integration tests
   
5. **Prevent regression:**
   - Implement code review process
   - Add automated testing
   - Consider linting for SQL syntax
