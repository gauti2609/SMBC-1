## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Cannot Test GUI in This Environment
This is a **Desktop Application** (PyQt5), not a web app:
- ❌ Won't run in browser (no localhost URL)
- ❌ Won't display in Dev Container (no display server)
- ✅ **Will work perfectly on Windows 10/11**

### Current Environment
We're building in a Linux container (for code development). The final app will:
- Be packaged as `.exe` for Windows
- Run without Python installation
- Include all dependencies bundled
- Work on any Windows 10/11 computer

## ❓ FAQs

### Q: Can I test the Master Data module now?
**A**: Yes! Run `python test_master_data_crud.py` to see all operations working.

### Q: Can I see the UI?
**A**: Not in this dev container (no display server). You'll need to run on Windows 10/11 to see the actual GUI. The code is ready and tested.

### Q: When will I get the .exe file?
**A**: After we complete:
  1. Company Info module (next, 2-3 hours)
  2. Trial Balance import (4-5 hours)
  3. Input Forms (8-10 hours)
  4. Generation engines (8-10 hours)
  5. PyInstaller packaging (1-2 hours)
  
  **Estimated**: 4-5 more development sessions

### Q: Will it work on my Windows computer?
**A**: Yes! Once packaged as `.exe`:
  - No Python installation needed
  - All dependencies bundled
  - Just double-click to run
  - Works on Windows 10/11

### Q: What if I need to customize the Master Data?
**A**: The UI makes it easy:
  - Add your own Major/Minor/Grouping heads
  - Edit default names if needed
  - Delete unused accounts
  - Import bulk changes from Excel

### Q: Is my data safe?
**A**: Yes!
  - SQLite database (local file, no internet required)
  - Soft deletes (data preserved, just hidden)
