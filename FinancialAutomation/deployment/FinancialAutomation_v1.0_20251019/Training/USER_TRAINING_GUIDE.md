capital, equity, reserve ‚Üí Equity
salary, wages, rent, expense ‚Üí Expense accounts
sales, revenue, income ‚Üí Revenue accounts
```

**Auto-Mapping Success Rate:**

### 4.4 Manual Mapping

**For Unmapped Accounts:**

   - Right-click ‚Üí "Bulk Map"
   - Choose major head
   - Click "Apply to Selected"

4. **Verify Mapping**
   - Check mapping status summary
   - Review each major head total
   - Ensure all accounts are classified

**Example Mapping Decisions:**
```
Account Name              ‚Üí Recommended Major Head
Security Deposit - Rent   ‚Üí Other Non-Current Assets

## MODULE 5: SELECTION SHEET (45 minutes)

### 5.1 Understanding the Selection Sheet

**What is it?**
The Selection Sheet determines which Schedule III notes will be included in your financial statements.

**Why is it needed?**
Not all companies need all 27 notes. For example:
- Service company doesn't need "Inventories" note
- Company without borrowings doesn't need "Borrowings" note
- Company without related party transactions doesn't need that note

**How it works:**
1. System analyzes your Trial Balance
2. Recommends relevant notes based on data
3. You review and override as needed
4. Selected notes get sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...)
5. These numbers appear in final statements

### 5.2 Selection Sheet Categories

**68 Notes Across 7 Categories:**

**Category A: Accounting Policies (Mandatory)**
- A.1 - Corporate information
- A.2 - Significant accounting policies
- A.2.1 to A.2.14 - Policy details

**Category B: Balance Sheet Notes (27 notes)**
- B.1 to B.27 - All Schedule III notes

**Category C-G: Additional Notes**
- C.1 to C.4 - Contingent liabilities
- D.1 to D.3 - Related parties
- E.1 to E.5 - Employee benefits
- F.1 to F.3 - Segment reporting
- G.1 to G.4 - Other disclosures

### 5.3 System Recommendations

**How Recommendations Work:**

After Trial Balance import, click "Update Note Recommendations" button:

```
Analyzing Trial Balance...
‚úì Found PPE accounts ‚Üí Recommend Note B.1
‚úì Found Receivables ‚Üí Recommend Note B.10
‚úì Found Cash/Bank ‚Üí Recommend Note B.13
‚úì Found Payables ‚Üí Recommend Note B.24
‚úì Found Borrowings ‚Üí Recommend Note B.20
‚úì Found Equity accounts ‚Üí Recommend Notes B.3-B.4
```

**Recommendation Logic:**
- Account balance > 0 ‚Üí Note recommended
- Specific keywords ‚Üí Related note recommended
- Zero balance ‚Üí Note not recommended (but can override)

### 5.4 Using the Selection Sheet Interface

**Table Columns:**

1. **Note Ref** - Schedule III reference (A.1, B.1, etc.)
2. **Description** - Full note description
3. **Linked Major Head** - Related account category
4. **System Recommendation** - Yes/No (green if Yes)
5. **User Selection** - Your override (dropdown: Yes/No/Blank)
6. **Final Selection** - Computed result
7. **Auto Number** - Sequential number for selected notes

**Workflow:**

**Step 1: Generate Recommendations**
```
Trial Balance tab ‚Üí Click "Update Note Recommendations"
‚Üí Auto-switches to Selection Sheet tab
‚Üí Dialog: "28 notes recommended"
```

**Step 2: Review Recommendations**
- Green rows = Recommended by system
- White rows = Not recommended
- Scroll through all 68 notes

**Step 3: Override as Needed**
- Click dropdown in "User Selection" column
- Choose "Yes" to force include
- Choose "No" to force exclude
- Choose "Blank" to use system recommendation

**Step 4: Update Auto-Numbering**
```
Click "Update Auto-Numbering" button
‚Üí Selected notes get numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4...
‚Üí Numbers appear in "Auto Number" column
```

**Step 5: Verify Selection**
- Count: Should be 15-30 notes typically
- Check all mandatory notes included
- Review numbering sequence

### 5.5 Common Selection Scenarios

Goes to Note_1 (PPE)
Changes "Computers - Additions" from 30.00 to 40.00
Gross Block increases by 10.00
Net Block increases by 10.00 (assuming no depreciation change)
Returns to Balance Sheet
PPE line item automatically shows new total
Total Assets automatically recalculates
```

**Verify Formula Linking:**
1. Open exported file
2. Go to Balance Sheet
3. Click on any amount with note reference
4. Check formula bar (shows ='Note_X'!CellRef)
