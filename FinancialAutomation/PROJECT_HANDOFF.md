## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **UI Framework:** PyQt5
- **Database:** SQLite (single-user) / PostgreSQL (multi-user)
- **Security:** bcrypt password hashing
- **Export:** openpyxl for Excel

### Architecture Pattern
```
3-Layer Architecture:
┌─────────────────┐
│   UI Layer      │  PyQt5 Forms, Tables, HTML
│  (Views)        │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ Business Logic  │  Generators, Calculators
│   (Models)      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│  Data Layer     │  SQLite/PostgreSQL
│  (Database)     │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Desktop-First Approach**
   - Why: Immediate deployment without web infrastructure
   - Future: Web version planned for v2.0

2. **SQLite Default**
   - Why: Zero-configuration, perfect for small firms
   - Alternative: PostgreSQL for multi-user (fully supported)

3. **PyQt5 for UI**
   - Why: Native look, professional widgets, mature framework
   - Trade-off: Slightly larger executable size

4. **Schedule III Models**
   - Why: Each model has `get_schedule_iii_format()` for consistency
   - Benefit: Generators just aggregate, very maintainable

## 🎓 Knowledge Transfer

### For Developers Taking Over

**Getting Started:**
1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` first
2. Study `models/financial_statements.py` - this is the core
3. Look at `views/financials_tab.py` to see how generators are called
4. Examine one input form: `views/ppe_input_form.py`
5. Review `config/database.py` for schema

**Key Concepts:**

1. **CY/PY Everywhere:**
   - Every table has `_cy` and `_py` versions
   - Every form has CY and PY tabs
   - All models have `@classmethod` methods that take `company_id` and `year_type`

2. **Schedule III Format Method:**
   - Every model has `get_schedule_iii_format(company_id, year_type)`
   - Returns dict with required keys for generators
   - Generators just aggregate these dicts

3. **Master Data Hierarchy:**
   - Major Heads (e.g., "Current Assets")
   - Minor Heads (e.g., "Inventories")
   - Groupings (e.g., "Raw Materials")
   - 3-level hierarchy for trial balance mapping

4. **Database Session Management:**
   - Use `with get_db_session() as session:` always
   - Auto-commits on success, auto-rollbacks on error
   - Never commit manually

### For End Users

**Training Workflow:**
1. Watch/read USER_GUIDE.md
2. Try the 8-step workflow with sample data
3. Import sample Trial Balance (create one)
4. Enter 2-3 PPE items
5. Enter 1 CWIP project
6. Enter 2-3 investments
7. Generate financial statements
8. Review Balance Sheet, P&L, Notes

**Common Questions (from FAQs in USER_GUIDE):**
- "How do I import Trial Balance?" → See USER_GUIDE.md Section 4.1
- "What if Balance Sheet doesn't balance?" → Check Selection Sheet mappings
- "Where is depreciation shown?" → Auto-calculated from PPE, shows in P&L
- "Can I compare with last year?" → Yes, all statements show CY vs PY

### For IT/System Admins

**Deployment Checklist:**
1. Choose deployment option (Single/Multi/Cloud)
2. Follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md step-by-step
3. Set up backups (scripts provided)
4. Configure firewall rules (if PostgreSQL)
5. Test with sample data
6. Train end users
7. Go live

**Backup Strategy:**
- SQLite: Daily automated backups to network drive
- PostgreSQL: Daily `pg_dump` + weekly full backups
- See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md → "Backup & Recovery"
