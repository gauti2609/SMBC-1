    - Tab 3: Cash Flow Statement
    - Tab 4: Notes to Accounts (read-only, auto-generated)
    - Export buttons (PDF, Excel, Word)
```

---

### Priority 2: Selection Sheet Enhancement (2-3 hours)
**File: views/selection_sheet_tab.py** (already exists)

Currently has basic structure. Needs:
- Drag-drop interface OR checkboxes to map Trial Balance items to Schedule III line items
- Save mapping configuration per company
- Apply same mapping to both CY and PY
- Visual indicators for mapped vs unmapped items

---

### Priority 3: Quick Input Forms (1-2 hours) - OPTIONAL
Simple table-based forms for:
- Inventories (already have model, just need UI)
- Trade Receivables detail (if time permits)
- Trade Payables detail (if time permits)

**Note:** These are less critical because we can use Trial Balance for aggregates and only use detailed forms if user wants granular tracking.

---

## üéØ TODAY'S ACTION PLAN

1. **Create `models/financial_statements.py`** (2 hours)
   - BalanceSheetGenerator class

## üìä DELIVERABLE FEATURES

### Must-Have (Today)
- ‚úÖ Balance Sheet in Schedule III format (CY vs PY)
- ‚úÖ P&L Statement in Schedule III format (CY vs PY)
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated Notes to Accounts (Notes 1, 2, 3, 8, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Excel export of financial statements
- ‚úÖ Selection Sheet with basic mapping

### Nice-to-Have (If Time)
- ‚≠ê PDF export with professional formatting
- ‚≠ê Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method)
- ‚≠ê Detailed input forms for Inventories, Receivables, Payables
- ‚≠ê Drag-drop selection sheet
- ‚≠ê Comparison graphs (CY vs PY)

---

## üöÄ EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Approach: Minimum Viable Product First
1. **Get Balance Sheet working FIRST** - This is 80% of the value
2. **Then P&L** - Completes the financial picture
3. **Then Notes** - Shows detailed breakdowns
4. **Then export** - Makes it usable
5. **Then polish** - Selection sheet, additional forms

### Code Reuse
- All input forms already have `get_schedule_iii_format()` methods
- Just need to aggregate them in the financial statements generator
- Trial Balance already has mapping structure

### Testing Data
Use the test data already created:
- Company: Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd
- PPE: ‚Çπ18.65M (CY), ‚Çπ16M (PY)
- CWIP: ‚Çπ9.3M (CY), ‚Çπ7.8M (PY)
- Investments: ‚Çπ39.1M (CY), ‚Çπ29.82M (PY)

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### Completion Criteria:
1. ‚úÖ Can generate Balance Sheet showing all major line items
2. ‚úÖ Balance Sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
3. ‚úÖ Can generate P&L with revenue, expenses, and profit
4. ‚úÖ Notes auto-populate from input forms
5. ‚úÖ Can export to Excel
6. ‚úÖ Selection sheet allows basic mapping

### Quality Criteria:
- Schedule III compliance (Indian accounting standards)
- CY vs PY comparative numbers
- Proper formatting and labels
- Professional appearance
- No calculation errors

---

## üí™ MOMENTUM FACTORS

### Working in Our Favor:
1. ‚úÖ Database schema is complete and tested
2. ‚úÖ All input forms have data models ready
3. ‚úÖ Schedule III structure is well-documented
4. ‚úÖ Test data exists for verification
5. ‚úÖ Core infrastructure (authentication, company management) is solid

### Challenges:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Financial statements logic is complex (many line items)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to handle missing data gracefully
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Excel/PDF export needs proper formatting
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Balance Sheet must balance (tricky with Trial Balance integration)

---

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP

**START HERE:**
```python
# File: models/financial_statements.py
# Line 1: class BalanceSheetGenerator:
#   Method 1: get_non_current_assets()
#   Method 2: get_current_assets()
#   Method 3: get_equity()
#   Method 4: get_non_current_liabilities()
#   Method 5: get_current_liabilities()
#   Method 6: generate() ‚Üí returns dict with all sections
```

This is the heart of the application. Everything else is just data input - this is where we transform data into INSIGHTS.
