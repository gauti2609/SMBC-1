# Bug Fixes Complete - October 22, 2025

## All Critical and High Priority Bugs Fixed ✅

### Bug #1: SQL Placeholder Mix (CRITICAL) ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Status:** Already fixed in previous session
**Location:** `models/trial_balance.py:152-158`
**Fix:** All SQL placeholders now use `%s` (PostgreSQL style) - no mixed `?` and `%s`

### Bug #2: Missing RETURNING Clause (HIGH) ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Status:** Already fixed in previous session
**Location:** `models/trial_balance.py:53-68`
**Fix:** Added `RETURNING tb_id` to INSERT statement

### Bug #3: Connection Pool Leaks (HIGH) ✅ FIXED NOW
**Status:** **NEWLY FIXED**
**Location:** `models/trial_balance.py` (multiple methods)
**Methods Fixed:**
- ✅ `get_by_company()` - Added try-finally block
- ✅ `get_unmapped()` - Added try-finally block
- ✅ `validate_balance()` - Added try-finally block
- ✅ `get_summary_stats()` - Added try-finally block
- ✅ `bulk_import()` - Added try-finally with rollback

**Pattern Applied:**
```python
conn = None
try:
    conn = get_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # ... execute queries ...
    conn.commit()  # for write operations
    return result
except Exception as e:
    if conn:
        conn.rollback()  # for write operations
    raise e
finally:
    if conn:
        conn.close()  # ALWAYS close connection
```

### Bug #4: Constructor Parameters (MEDIUM) ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Status:** Already fixed in previous session
**Location:** `models/master_data.py:88-92`
**Fix:** Constructor parameters properly ordered with named arguments

### Bug #5: Deprecated Method (MEDIUM) ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Status:** Already fixed in previous session
**Location:** `models/master_data.py:52-55`
**Fix:** Proper DeprecationWarning added to deprecated method

### Bug #6: No Migration System (LOW) ⏸️ DEFERRED
**Status:** Deferred to future sprint (not critical for .exe deployment)
**Location:** `config/database.py`
**Reason:** Low priority, doesn't affect current functionality
