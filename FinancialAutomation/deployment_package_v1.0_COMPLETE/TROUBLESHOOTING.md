# Troubleshooting Guide - Login/Main Window Issues

## Issue: "Login window closes immediately after login/register"

### ‚úÖ Fixes Applied:

1. **Database initialization moved** - Now happens AFTER Qt app starts (so errors can be shown)
2. **Comprehensive error handling** - Every step wrapped in try/except with user-friendly messages
3. **Debug logging added** - Prints to console to see exactly where it fails
4. **Main window visibility** - Explicitly calls `show()`, `raise_()`, `activateWindow()`
5. **Login window kept open** - Only closes if main window opens successfully

---

## üîç How to Debug:

### Step 1: Run from Command Line (See Error Messages)

Instead of double-clicking the .exe, run it from command prompt:

```cmd
cd C:\Path\To\Your\Application
FinancialAutomation.exe
```

**You will see debug output like:**
```
Initializing database...
Database initialized successfully
Creating login window...
Login window shown
Creating main window for user: john
Initializing UI...
UI initialized successfully
Loading last session...
Last session loaded
MainWindow initialization complete
Main window shown and activated
Closing login window
Login window closed
```

### Step 2: Check for Error Messages

If something fails, you'll see **exactly where**:

**Example 1: Database connection error**
```
Initializing database...
‚ùå Failed to create PostgreSQL pool: connection refused
Database initialization error: ...
[Error dialog appears with instructions]
```

**Example 2: Main window initialization error**
```
Creating main window for user: john
Initializing UI...
Error initializing main window: relation "company_info" does not exist
[Login window stays open with error dialog]
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: "Login window closes, nothing appears"

**Cause:** Main window crashes during initialization

**Debug:**
1. Run from command line (see output)
2. Look for error after "Creating main window for user: ..."
3. Check if database tables exist

**Solution:**
- If you see "relation does not exist" ‚Üí Database tables not created
- If you see "connection refused" ‚Üí PostgreSQL not running
- If you see "authentication failed" ‚Üí Wrong credentials in .env

### Issue 2: "Database initialization error"

**Cause:** Cannot connect to database on startup

**Solutions:**
- **PostgreSQL:** Make sure it's running (`pg_ctl status`)
- **Check .env file exists** in same folder as .exe
- **Check credentials** in .env match your database
- **Create database** if it doesn't exist:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE financial_automation;
  ```

### Issue 3: "Table creation order error"

**Cause:** Old version of code with table order bug

**Solution:** This is fixed in latest deployment package
- Make sure you're using `deployment_package_v1.0_COMPLETE.zip` (117KB)
- Date: October 21, 2025

## üìã Checklist Before Running:

- [ ] PostgreSQL server is running
- [ ] Database `financial_automation` exists
- [ ] User `fin_app_user` has permissions
- [ ] `.env` file is in same folder as `.exe`
- [ ] `.env` has correct credentials (POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, etc.)
- [ ] Running from command line to see errors

---

## üîß Test Database Connection:

Run this in command prompt to verify database works:

```cmd
psql -U fin_app_user -d financial_automation -c "SELECT version();"
```

**If this works**, your database connection is fine.

**If this fails**, fix database connection first.

## üìù What the Debug Output Shows:

### Successful startup:
```
Initializing database...              ‚Üê Database connection OK
Database initialized successfully     ‚Üê Tables created/verified
Creating login window...               ‚Üê Login UI created
Login window shown                     ‚Üê You should see login window
[You login]
Creating main window for user: john   ‚Üê Starting main window
Initializing UI...                     ‚Üê Creating tabs, menus, etc.
UI initialized successfully            ‚Üê All UI components ready
Loading last session...                ‚Üê Checking for saved state
Last session loaded                    ‚Üê Session loaded (or new session)
MainWindow initialization complete     ‚Üê Main window ready
Main window shown and activated        ‚Üê You should see main window
Closing login window                   ‚Üê Login window closing
Login window closed                    ‚Üê Login window gone

## üöÄ Quick Fix Summary:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| App closes immediately on startup | Database connection fails | Check PostgreSQL running, .env file |
| Login window closes, nothing shows | Main window crash | Run from command line, see error |
| "relation does not exist" | Tables not created | Use latest package with table order fix |
| "authentication failed" | Wrong password in .env | Update .env with correct credentials |

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior (After Fixes):

1. **Run .exe** ‚Üí Database initializes (2-3 seconds)
2. **Login window appears** ‚Üí Fill in username/password
3. **Click Login** ‚Üí 
   - ‚úÖ Main window appears (with welcome screen)
   - ‚úÖ Login window closes
   - ‚úÖ You see: "Welcome, [Your Name]!"
4. **Create/Open Company** ‚Üí All features work

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you still see the problem after these fixes:

1. **Run from command line** and copy **ALL** the output
2. **Look for the last line** before it crashes
3. **Check the .env file** - share the file (hide password)
4. **PostgreSQL logs** - check for connection attempts
