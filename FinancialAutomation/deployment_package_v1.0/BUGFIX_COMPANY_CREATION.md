# Bug Fix: Company Creation Dialog Issue

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Company creation dialog closes without executing tab switch  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

When user clicks "Create New Company" button:
- ❌ **Expected:** Dialog shows, user clicks OK, Company Info tab opens with cleared form
- ❌ **Actual:** Dialog shows message, user clicks OK, dialog closes, nothing happens

The informational `QMessageBox` was blocking the workflow - user had to click OK before the tab switch occurred, but then lost context about what to do next.

---

## Root Cause

**File:** `views/main_window.py`  
**Method:** `new_company()` (lines 623-635)

```python
def new_company(self):
    """Create new company - switch to Company Info tab"""
    if hasattr(self, 'company_info_tab'):
        self.tab_widget.setCurrentWidget(self.company_info_tab)
        self.company_info_tab.clear_form()
        QMessageBox.information(  # ❌ BLOCKING DIALOG
            self, "New Company",
            "Please fill in the Company Information form and click 'Save Company Info'.\n\n"
            "After saving, the company will appear in the Company selector."
        )
    else:
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Company Info tab not initialized")
```

**Issues:**
1. `QMessageBox.information()` is a **blocking modal dialog** - execution stops until user clicks OK
2. User clicks OK → Dialog closes → User doesn't see the Company Info tab that already opened behind the dialog
3. No visual feedback that tab switch occurred

---

## Solution Implemented

**Approach:** Remove blocking dialog, use non-intrusive status bar message instead

### Code Changes

**File:** `views/main_window.py`  
**Lines Changed:** 623-635

```python
def new_company(self):
    """Create new company - switch to Company Info tab"""
    if hasattr(self, 'company_info_tab') and hasattr(self, 'tab_widget'):
        # Switch to Company Info tab
        self.tab_widget.setCurrentWidget(self.company_info_tab)
        # Clear the form for new entry
        self.company_info_tab.clear_form()
        # Show status message (non-blocking)
        self.status_bar.showMessage("Please fill in the company information and click 'Save Company Info'")
    else:
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Company Info tab not initialized")
```

### What Changed

1. ✅ **Removed blocking dialog** - No more `QMessageBox.information()`
2. ✅ **Added status bar message** - `self.status_bar.showMessage()` provides guidance without blocking
3. ✅ **Added safety check** - `hasattr(self, 'tab_widget')` ensures widget exists
4. ✅ **Immediate visual feedback** - User instantly sees Company Info tab with cleared form
5. ✅ **Persistent guidance** - Status bar message stays visible while user fills form

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Login to application** with credentials (gautam@smbcllp.com)
2. **Click "Create New Company"** button in toolbar OR File → New Company
3. **Verify behavior:**
   - ✅ Application immediately switches to "Company Info" tab
   - ✅ Form fields are cleared and ready for input
   - ✅ Status bar shows: "Please fill in the company information and click 'Save Company Info'"
   - ✅ No blocking dialog appears
   - ✅ User can immediately start typing

### Expected Results

- Tab switches to "Company Info" **instantly** without dialog interruption
- Form is **empty** (cleared) ready for new company data entry
- Status bar provides **guidance** without blocking workflow
- User has clear visual feedback of what to do next

## Developer Notes

### Why Status Bar Instead of Dialog?

1. **Non-blocking:** User can immediately interact with form
2. **Persistent:** Message stays visible during data entry
3. **Contextual:** User sees guidance while working on the task
4. **UX Best Practice:** Avoid modal dialogs for informational messages

### Alternative Approaches Considered

- ❌ **Tooltip:** Too temporary, user might miss it
- ❌ **Toast notification:** Disappears too quickly
- ❌ **Help text in tab:** Not visible enough
- ✅ **Status bar:** Perfect balance of visibility and non-intrusiveness

### Future Enhancements (v1.1)

- Add inline help text in Company Info tab header
- Implement form validation with real-time feedback
- Add "Quick Start Wizard" for first-time users
- Tooltip hints for required fields
