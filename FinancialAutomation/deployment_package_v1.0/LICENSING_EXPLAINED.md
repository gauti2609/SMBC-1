# 📜 Licensing System Explained

## Current Behavior

The application includes a **trial licensing system** with these features:

### 🔐 Default Behavior
1. **New User Registration** → Automatically gets 30-day trial license
2. **Login** → Checks if user has an active license
3. **No License** → Shows error: "Login failed: No active license found"

### 📅 Trial License Details
- **Duration**: 30 days from registration date
- **Type**: Trial (automatic on registration)
- **Expiry**: Calculated as `registration_date + 30 days`

---

## ❓ Why You're Seeing the Error

You registered the user **`gautam@smbcllp.com`**, which should have created a trial license automatically. The error "No active license found" means either:

1. **Database not initialized** - The `licenses` table doesn't exist yet
2. **Registration didn't complete** - License creation failed during registration
3. **Database connection issue** - Using wrong database (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)

---

## 🎯 Two Solutions

### Option 1: Remove Licensing (Recommended for Internal Use) ✅

**Best for**: Internal company use, single organization

Make the app work **without any license checks** - just login and use!

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No trial periods
- ✅ No license expiry
- ✅ Unlimited users
- ✅ Simpler workflow
- ✅ Perfect for internal/company-wide deployment

**Implementation**: Modify the authentication to skip license validation

---

### Option 2: Keep Licensing (For Commercial Distribution)

**Best for**: Selling to multiple clients, software as a product

Keep the 30-day trial system with these options:
- Generate permanent license keys for specific users
- Extend trial periods
- Implement license key activation system

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options

### Fix 1: Disable License Check (Easiest) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

This removes all licensing restrictions and makes the app free to use for your organization.

**Changes needed**:
1. Modify `controllers/auth_controller.py` - Remove license validation on login
2. Modify `views/main_window.py` - Remove license status checks
3. Modify `views/login_window.py` - Remove trial license creation message

**Result**: Clean login → No license warnings → Works forever

---

### Fix 2: Initialize Database Properly

If you want to keep licensing, you need to:
1. Run `python demo_db_setup_simple.py` to create all tables
2. Register a new user (creates trial license)
3. Login works for 30 days

**Issue**: Your current error suggests the database wasn't initialized when you registered.

---

### Fix 3: Create Permanent License

Create a permanent license for your user:

```sql
-- Run this in PostgreSQL or SQLite
INSERT INTO licenses (user_id, license_key, license_type, issue_date, expiry_date, is_active)
VALUES (
    (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = 'gautam@smbcllp.com'),
    'PERMANENT-LICENSE-KEY',
    'full',
    CURRENT_DATE,
    '2099-12-31',  -- Far future date
    TRUE
);
```

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**For your use case (internal company tool)**: **Remove licensing entirely** ✅

**Reasons**:
1. You're not selling this software
2. It's for SMBC LLP internal use
3. No need for trial periods or restrictions
4. Simpler maintenance
5. Better user experience

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Choose one**:

### A. Remove Licensing (Recommended)
I can modify the code to remove all license checks. The app will:
- ✅ Simple login with username/password

### B. Fix Current Licensing
I can help you:
- Initialize the database properly
- Create permanent licenses for users

---

## 🎯 What Do You Want?

**Option 1**: Remove licensing completely (recommended for internal use)  
**Option 2**: Keep licensing but create permanent license for your users  
**Option 3**: Fix the database and keep 30-day trial system

## 📝 Technical Details

### Current Licensing Flow

```
User Registration
    ↓
Create User in Database
    ↓
Create Trial License (30 days) ← This step might have failed
    ↓
Show "30-day trial activated" message
    ↓
User tries to Login
    ↓
Check if License Exists ← ERROR HERE: "No active license found"
    ↓
If No License → Login Failed
If License Expired → Login Failed
If License Valid → Login Success
```

### Files Involved

1. **controllers/auth_controller.py** - Lines 70-75 (license validation on login)
2. **models/license.py** - License creation and validation logic
3. **views/login_window.py** - Line 235 (shows "30-day trial" message)
4. **views/main_window.py** - Line 25, 430 (license status checks)
5. **config/settings.py** - Line 109 (TRIAL_PERIOD_DAYS = 30)

## ⚠️ About the .exe File

**Is it supposed to be a portable .exe?**

**YES!** ✅ This is intentional. Benefits:

1. **No Installation Required** - Just run the .exe
2. **Portable** - Copy to any Windows PC and run
3. **No Admin Rights** - Doesn't need installation privileges
4. **Easy Distribution** - Email the .exe or put on network drive
5. **Multiple Versions** - Can run different versions side-by-side

**If you want an installer**:
- We can create an **Inno Setup** or **NSIS** installer
- It would create Start Menu shortcuts
- Register in Windows Programs
- Create Desktop icon
- But it's optional - current portable approach is perfectly fine!

**Current setup is actually BETTER for business use** - just copy the .exe to a network drive and everyone can use it!
